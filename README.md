# Project-Game

This is a project I was going to use for an assessment, but discovered I was trying to do too much at once and overwhelmed myself.

It was going to be a turn based combat game with a system to gain new random characters that you could swap in and out of your team.

With more planning and thinking ahead, this project might have worked, but I tried to make systems I didn't understand how to make.
